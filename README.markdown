CWAC-Presentation: Second Screens Supported Succinctly
======================================================

This Android library project (also
[available as a JAR](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-presentation/releases))
offers a series of classes that wrap around the `Presentation` and
`DisplayManager` of Android 4.2: 

- `PresentationHelper` consolidates basic `DisplayManager` handling, with
a listener to inform you when to show or remove your `Presentation`

- `PresentationFragment` extends `DialogFragment` and adds a bit of
extra logic to allow it to handle a `Presentation` rather than a simple
`Dialog`

- `WebPresentationFragment` simply extends `PresentationFragment` and displays
a `WebView` in the `Presentation`

- `MirroringFragment`, `MirroringWebViewFragment`, and `MirrorPresentationFragment`
leverage the mirroring logic from
[the CWAC-Layouts project](http://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-layouts) to help you
display a `Presentation` based upon mirrored content from the main screen

Note that if you wish to use the JAR, you will need to also add the JAR from
[the CWAC-Layouts project](http://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-layouts) to your
project if you wish to use the `Mirror*` classes. If you are not using the `Mirror*`
classes, then the CWAC-Presentation JAR is sufficient.

Also note that if you plan to use this as an Android library project that you
will also need to download [the CWAC-Layouts project](http://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-layouts)
(and, if needed, modify this project's configuration to point to your copy of
CWAC-Layouts' library project). Alternatively, download the CWAC-Layouts JAR into
the `libs/` directory of your clone of this project and remove the dependency on
the CWAC-Layouts library project.

Usage: PresentationHelper
-------------------------
`PresentationHelper` is designed to be used by an `Activity` that wishes to
display a `Presentation` when a suitable `Display` is attached, and stop displaying
the `Presentation` when any prior such `Display` is detached.

To do this:

- Create an instance of `PresentationHelper`, probably in `onCreate()` of the
activity. You will need to supply a `Context` (probably `this`) and something
that implements the `PresentationHelper.Listener` interface.

- Forward the `onPause()` and `onResume()` events to the `PresentationHelper` by
calling the same-named methods on the helper.

- Implement the `showPreso()` method on your `Listener`. This receives a `Display`
object, and you are now able to display a `Presentation` on that `Display`.

- Implement the `clearPreso()` method on your `Listener`. At this point, you
should stop displaying any prior `Presentation`, if there was one. You are passed
a `boolean` value, `true` indicating that the activity is going away, `false`
indicating that we merely lost our `Display`. You can use this value to perhaps
optimize dealing with `Display` changes, without destroying all the data.

You can call `disable()` and `enable()` on the `PresentationHelper`. Calling
`disable()` stops the custom content and reverts the device to normal screen
mirroring mode. Calling `enable()` reverts a previous `disable()` call.

Usage: PresentationFragment
---------------------------
`PresentationFragment` is a thin veneer over `DialogFragment` to allow it to 
work with `Presentation` objects (which themselves inherit from `Dialog`).
This allows you to define the content for a `Presentation` in the form of
a fragment. And, like `DialogFragment`, you can elect to either use it for
a `Presentation` (via a call to `show()`) or use it as an ordinary `Fragment` in
the rest of your UI (via a `FragmentTransaction`). This can help you to work
both in dual-screen and single-screen scenarios.

Your `PresentationFragment` subclass should override `onCreateView()` to define
the contents of the `Presentation` (or what will be shown in the `Fragment`
when used as a regular fragment). The only significant change over any other
`Fragment` is that you should use `getContext()`, instead of `getActivity()`,
for any resources you create, such as inflating a layout. This ensures that
you get the right `Context` for the situation, such as the `Context` associated
with a secondary screen when used for a `Presentation`.

However, when creating the `PresentationFragment`, you also need to call
`setDisplay()`, to provide the `Display` object for use when the fragment is
shown as a `Presentation`. If you are not using it for a `Presentation` in
the current context, this call is not required. A typical approach for handling
`setDisplay()` is to use a factory method:

```
public static YourFragment newInstance(Context ctxt, Display display) {
  YourFragment frag=new YourFragment();

  frag.setDisplay(ctxt, display);

  return(frag);
}
```

Beyond this, `PresentationFragment` is a fairly ordinary `Fragment`.

If you wish to display this fragment in a `Presentation`, call `show()` on the
`PresentationFragment`, supplying your `FragmentManager` and a tag to use for
the fragment itself. To get rid of the `Presentation`, call `dismiss()` on
the `PresentationFragment`.

Usage: WebPresentationFragment
------------------------------
`WebPresentationFragment` is simply a mash-up of `PresentationFragment` and
`WebViewFragment`, to allow a `WebView` to be displayed in a `Presentation`.
You use it just like `WebViewFragment`, except for the need to call
`setDisplay()` (per the `PresentationFragment` instructions above). So,
for example, `getWebView()` returns the `WebView` hosted by the
`WebPresentationFragment`.

Usage: Mirroring Presentation Classes
-------------------------------------
There are three classes that take advantage of the mirroring support included
in [the CWAC-Layouts project](http://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-layouts).

`MirroringFragment` works much like a regular `Fragment`. However, instead of
overriding `onCreateView()`, you override `onCreateMirroredContent()`.
`onCreateMirroredContent()` takes the same parameters as does `onCreateView()`,
and your job is the same: create the content to be displayed by the fragment.
The difference is that your returned `View` will be wrapped in a
`MirroringFrameLayout`.

`MirroringWebViewFragment` is a mash-up of `MirroringFragment` and
`WebViewFragment`, to allow a `WebView` to be mirrored. Use `getWebView()`
to retrieve the `WebView` hosted by this fragment.

`MirrorPresentationFragment` is a `PresentationFragment` designed to mirror
the contents of a `MirroringFragment`. To use this, create an instance using
the `newInstance()` factory method, taking a `Context` and the desired
`Display` as parameters. Then, call `setMirror()` on your `MirroringFragment`,
supplying the `MirrorPresentationFragment`. From there, you can `show()`
and `dismiss()` the `MirrorPresentationFragment` as you would any other
`PresentationFragment`. By having the `MirroringFragment` on the main
screen, and having the `MirrorPresentationFragment` on an external display,
whatever the user manipulates on the screen is rendered to the external
display, ideal for presentation settings (e.g., conferences).

Note that `MirroringFragment` suffers the same limitations as does
`MirroringFrameLayout`, in that it will work with fairly ordinary `View`s,
plus `WebView`, but not `SurfaceView` or things that use `SurfaceView`
(e.g., `VideoView`, Maps V2 maps).

Dependencies
------------
This project depends on Android 4.2 and higher (API Level 17) to actually
do its work. It should survive on older devices, simply doing nothing.

This project also depends upon
[the CWAC-Layouts project](http://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-layouts).

Version
-------
This is version v0.2.0 of this module, meaning it is being let out of
its cage and exercised a bit more.

Demo
----
In the `demo/` sub-project you will find a sample project demonstrating the use
of all the aforementioned classes.
